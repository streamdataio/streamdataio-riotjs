#Get your hands dirty with Riot.js

This branch contains the code of the [event-driven app posts](http://streamdata.io/blog/exploring-riot-js-part3-1/) of our series around [Riot.js](http://riotjs.com/).

# Starting the sample

In a terminal, run the command:
- `npm run serve` (live-edit)

A browser should be opened at: `http://localhost:3000/app/`
